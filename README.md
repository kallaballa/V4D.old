# V4D
V4D is a high performance visualization module for [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv). It features vector graphics using [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) a GUI based on [NanoGUI](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/nanogui) and (on supported systems) OpenCL/OpenGL and OpenCL/VAAPI interoperability. It should be included in [OpenCV-contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) once it is ready.

# What is V4D?
V4D is a way of writing graphical (on- and offscreen) high performance applications with OpenCV. It is light-weight and unencumbered by QT or GTK licenses.

# Why V4D?
Please refer to the [online demos](https://github.com/kallaballa/V4D/blob/main/README.md#online-demos) to see at a glance what it can do for you.

* OpenGL: Easy access to OpenGL.
* GUI: Simple yet powerful user interfaces through NanoGUI.
* Vector graphics: Elegant and fast vector graphics through NanoVG.
* Font rendering: Loading of TTF-fonts and sophisticated rendering options.
* Video pipeline: Through a simple Source/Sink system videos can be displayed, edited and saved.
* Hardware acceleration: Automatic hardware acceleration usage where possible. (e.g. cl-gl sharing and VAAPI). Actually it is possible to write programs that run almost entirely on the GPU, given driver-features are available.
* No more highgui with it's heavy dependencies, licenses and limitations.
* WebAssembly
